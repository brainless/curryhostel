# Basic idea

I recorded this video to explain the artist residency:

[![What is the Art Residency](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6hnvukTSw9c/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6hnvukTSw9c)

# Costs

Two weeks of accommodation (in our dorm rooms) and lunch is **free** for accepted residents. You can stay longer (at our usual costs) if you wish to. You can find our [accomodation details here](/about/costs-and-booking/).

We have a decent sized library, workroom, broadband Internet, professional microphone (Blue Yeti), electronic drums (Roland TD 17 series), elecrtonic keyboard (Yamaha).
We also have basic art supplies like different kinds of paper, canvas and colors.
We have a fully equipped kitchen (including baking oven and dishwasher) where you can cook yourself.

# Application process

Please message us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/curryhostel/) with the following:

1. Share your visible creative profile - anywhere online
2. Provide us with a rough idea of the project you want to work on during your stay
3. Please tell us why a space like Curry Hostel is on your mind
4. Please [check your travel options](/about/how-to-reach-curry-hostel) and tell us when you would like to stay here

**Notes**:

- Your project can be anything - including commercial work
- We limit this program to two attendees per month

# Other details

You will not have any responsibilities toward the hostel. You are free to work on anything you want, your own projects. We are not a party hostel. Drinking and smoking are allowed but like you would in your home (with family and friends) - please keep that in mind.

That's it, we keep things simple.
