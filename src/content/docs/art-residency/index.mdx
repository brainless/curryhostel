# Basic idea

I recorded this video to explain the artist residency:

[![What is the Art Residency](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6hnvukTSw9c/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6hnvukTSw9c)

# Costs, facilities and food

Costs (stay in our dorm rooms):

- Two week stay: Rs 6000/-
- One month stay: Rs 10,000/-

We have a decent sized library, workroom, broadband Internet, professional microphone (Blue Yeti), electronic drums (Roland TD 17 series), elecrtonic keyboard (Yamaha).
We also have basic art supplies like different kinds of paper, canvas and colors.
We have a fully equipped kitchen (including baking oven and dishwasher) where you can cook yourself. Lunch is provided daily and is included in the price.

Other than that, these special meals are also included:

1. Lunch on Thursdays
2. Dinner on Saturdays

You can use our washing machine (Rs 100 for a full machine load). We have a dishwasher and we want everyone to make sure their dishes are put in after eating so the kitchen stays clean.

# Booking process

There is no selection or application process for the art residency. We only ask you for a visible art profile, like on Instagram.

Once you check your travel options, you can confirm with us by sharing your travel tickets. We limit this program to two attendees at a time, on a first come first served basis.

# Other details

You will not have any responsibilities toward the hostel. You are free to work on anything you want, your own projects. We are not a party hostel. Drinking and smoking are allowed but like you would in your home (with family and friends) - please keep that in mind.

That's it, we keep things simple.
