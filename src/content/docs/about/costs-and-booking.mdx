title: Costs and booking
description: The retreat started in 2023 as an effort to bring like-minded people to experience the slow life, bring their arts and creative endeavors, walk in the tea garden or forests, meet local people and generally be happy and healthy. Thatâ€™s it, no other agenda. If we can create some art, share music, work with the local public school, our goal will be accomplished!
